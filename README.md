# spotify-clone
I have built spotify clone to hone my skills and also to learn more in depth about how does spotify works in backend. Also it's not mobile responsive but i tried my best so that it can be mobile responsive too.
So to be frank it's not exactly spotify but somewhat a music playlist where we can add songs play the songs and much more.
The web pages which i have built are Login, Sign up, About, Password reset process, home, home1, google authentication etc
It was fun also quite exhausting, most the timee I was finding clues and solving errors. But finally made something great .

Btw this app contains 2 types of integrated web players inside home.html and home1.html.
It still needs lots of improvements!!

I have used tailwind css, bootstrap, vanilla css, python, django framework, html, javascript.



<!-- This application is all about music player where user is able to listen to different songs.
I tried to copy spotify but only copied some of its easy features and successfully built it from scratch. My own added features are Login, Sign up, About section, Home page, Forgot password. I also implementd one of the cool features known as social media login, where user can sign up using Google and Facebook without facing any problems. 

IMPORTANT POINT : This application works best on either computer or laptop as some features aren't mobile friendly. 

NOTE: This site at first takes time to load as its free. 
So please wait for at least 30-40 seconds and then refresh the page once again to see the website.

Thank you! -->
