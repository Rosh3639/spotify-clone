# spotify-clone
I have built spotify clone to hone my skills and learn more in depth about how does spotify works in backend. 
It's not exactly spotify but somewhat a music playlist where we can add songs play themm and much more.
The web pages which i have built are Login, Sign up, About, Password reset process, home, home1, google authentication etc
It was fun also quite exhausting, most the timee I was finding clues and solving errors. But finally made something great .

Btw this app contains 2 types of integrated web players inside home.html and home1.html.
It still needs lots of improvements!!

I have used tailwind css, bootstrap, vanilla css, python, django framework, html, javascript.
